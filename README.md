# car-crush
a python application using the pyglet framework to simulate learning via neural networks

Car Crush is a Python application that demonstrates the capabilities of neural networks in the context of self-driving cars. It utilizes the Pyglet framework to create a virtual environment where a neural network can be trained to navigate autonomously. The application follows a two-step process: first, a neural network undergoes training using machine learning algorithms to learn how to pilot a vehicle through the simulated environment. Once trained, the neural network then gets to showcase its learned driving capabilities by controlling a self-driving car simulation within the Pyglet interface. Through this project, users can explore the intersection of neural networks and autonomous vehicles in an interactive and educational manner. Car Crush serves as a practical example of applying artificial intelligence techniques to tackle real-world problems like self-driving technology.
